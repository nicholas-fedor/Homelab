## Notes

While there's already a pre-built Docker image available for this application, I
opted instead to fork the source GitHub repository and the repository for the
Docker image to use as a source for building my own container image.

This is to start putting into practice the ability to modify, build, and deploy
applications without relying upon a third-party image maintainer.

This stems from recent experiences with using container images from maintainers
who discontinue supporting them and finding myself needing to setup this process
anyways.
