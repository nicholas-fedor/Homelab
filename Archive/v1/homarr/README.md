## Notes

- Attempted to setup Authentik OIDC auth; however, application appears to be
  persistently buggy. I am considering the built-in authentication to be
  untrustworthy, given the GitHub issues being filled with related commentary.
  Using Authentik in front of the application and retaining the application's
  built-in password-based authentication.
